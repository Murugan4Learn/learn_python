3. Mutability

Questions:
  8. Is string mutable?
  9. What is the difference between mutable and immutable objects?
  10. Does concatenating a string creates new object in memory?


Everything in python is an object
  In memory all datatypes are stored as objects

Mutability (Changeable or unchangable)
  String is immutable - It cannot grow or shrink within itself
  String concatenation leads to a new string object loaded in memory
